class AuthGateMiddleware:
    """
    ASGI middleware that enforces authentication for the wrapped child application,
    selectively bypassing the check for configured allowlisted paths.

    The middleware is designed to be HTMX-friendly: for HTMX requests, it returns a
    401 Unauthorized response with the **HX-Redirect** header, prompting the frontend
    to navigate to the login page without disrupting the main page navigation.
    It correctly handles mounted applications by normalizing paths relative to the child app.
