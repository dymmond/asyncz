# Esmerald

[Esmerald](https://esmerald.dymmond.com) is an ASGI python framework that is fast, scalable, easy
to learn, easy to code, for every sizable aaplication with business and design in mind and it works
for everyone.

Esmerald is also from the same author of Asyncz and therefore it makes sense to give native support
to the scheduler used by it directly.

This does not mean that Asyncz only works with Esmerald, not at all. You can use it with any of
your favourite framework directly or even better, you can [contribute](./../../contributing.md) to
Asyncz and suggest/add an integration with your favourite ASGI web framework as well.

Asyncz provides a [scheduler](./scheduler.md) and a [decorator](./decorator.md) that is internally
used by Esmerald to perform its tasks.
